I am a senior researcher at [National Institute of Biology](http://www.nib.si) and a full professor of Biostatistics and biometry at University of Ljubljana, Department of Biology.

With more than 30 years of experience in application of mathematics and statistics in biology I have a pleasure to work as a statistical consultant in diverse fields of biological research. My main interest is computational statistics and data visualization. Currently I am developing statistical methods for analysis of neurobiological data and microarray data analysis. As a lecturer of statistics and computer sciences at the Department of Biology, University of Ljubljana, I am developing computer supported graphical and statistical simulation systems for statistics education.
